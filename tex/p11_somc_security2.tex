\textit{\textbf{Self-employed Consultant, Mokshasoft}}

In this project I have continued working on a Linux/Android system level, with enterprise solutions and SELinux being the most important and interesting ones. Often our features depend on the availability of a trusted execution environment so our solutions are usually partly developed in ARM TrustZone. An important part of designing for security is to do threat models, which I have been doing for a few of our features. Last but not least, a really valuable impact I have had has been in the discussions we always have internally about what problems to solve and how to solve them with security in focus. Creativity and system knowledge helps a lot in these discussions.
