\textit{\textbf{Researcher/Hardware Developer}}

This project started as my masters thesis (Design and Implementation of an Asynchronous Pipelined FFT Processor), but later evolved to an employment when the thesis work was completed. I worked with research and development of a scalable FFT processor for wide transforms. The work consisted of development of a mathematical model, verification of the model in MATLAB, implementation in VHDL, and synthesis to a Virtex-II FPGA processor. The result led to a research paper "A GALS Based 16-Point Pipeline FFT Core" that was published on the NorChip Conference.
