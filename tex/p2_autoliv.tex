\item[2004-2005] \textbf{Autoliv Electronics}

\textit{\textbf{Systems Testing Consultant, Self-employed Consultant}}

I worked with verification of software and hardware in Autolivs airbag system. The project required testing, writing test reports, test case design and programming of test equipment. The work was partly very hands-on, required soldering on circuit boards and measurements with oscilloscopes. I was responsible for a smaller test area. Airbag systems have, unlike most other systems, very high standards when it comes to test and verification since bugs can have catastrophic consequences.
