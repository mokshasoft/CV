\item[2010-2013] \textbf{tastybits}

\textit{\textbf{Founder and all other possible roles...}}

I founded tastybits together with my girlfriend when we for six months were on leave of absence from our regular jobs. We escaped the winter in Sweden, you need that sometimes due to the cold :), to develop apps and games for iOS. The result was two completed and released games, Happy Letters and Zen Sudoku. These games were released in an iPhone and an iPad version. To live and run my own company in India when you have to handle all things in the company was very educational, not only technically but also for instance in graphical design and marketing. Apart from becoming a lot better at Objective-C and iOS development, I also became a much better programmer since I really wrote a lot of code for this company!
