\item[2011-2012] \textbf{Android Multimedia Framework, Sony Mobile}

\textit{\textbf{Senior Software Consultant, Netville}}

In this project I worked a lot with system stability and process programming problems. During the previous project at the multimedia department I had started prototyping an automated way to handle and prioritize stability problems, now this idea had evolved into a production system used by the whole software organization in the company. The results from this system led me to a new idea. I implemented that idea into a system that we used to analyze and fix deadlocks that were rare enough to be difficult to trigger with a test, but common enough during regular usage to be a real problem.

In addition to that I was also the lead programmer for the implementation of a new multimedia container format and for the implementation of a new streaming solution. In the former feature I had to work closely together with the DRM department.
