\item[2009-2010] \textbf{Android Multimedia Framework, Sony Ericsson}

\textit{\textbf{Senior Software Consultant, Netville}}

I worked as a streaming expert and troubleshooter in Sony Ericssons Android organization, i.e. manly focused on streaming problems but also on other multimedia areas in the Android platform. The work mostly dealt with troubleshooting the multimedia stack, everything from the application layer in Java, down to the platform via JNI, C++, ANSI C and finally to the codecs and their drivers.

Due to my managers faith in me I was often sent to different parts of the world to solve problems, mostly they dealt with the stability of the platform. I traveled both to clients, sub-contractors and other Sony Ericsson offices.
