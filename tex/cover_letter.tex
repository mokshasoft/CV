I am looking for challenging projects within Linux and/or open-source, and if software security is involved it makes it even better.\\\\
The reason I like to work with open-source is that it doesn't only benefit the company I am working for but also many others. Another reason, and as important, is the power you get when you can channel the work of thousands of others into the problem you are solving. For instance, if a tool lacks something that I need for a certain task, then I can just add it. This is not just a nice idea, this is something that I have done many times already.\\\\
So who am I as a person? I think most people would say that I am quite down-to-earth and easy to cooperate with. They would probably also see me as a pretty organized, persistent and creative person. Some people would probably think that these qualities don't come together, but I disagree. I think that creativity comes out of freedom or from an environment without pressure, and this is exactly what an organized way of working creates.\\\\
In my spare time I enjoy adventure, sports, yoga, meditation, hiking and a book now and then.
