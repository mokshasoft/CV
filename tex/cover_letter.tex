I am looking for open-source work in projects related to software security, Linux, seL4 or 3D modelling.\\\\
The reason I like to work with open-source is that it doesn't only benefit the company I am working for but also many others. That is very motivating for me. Another reason, and as important, is the power you get when you can channel the work of thousands of others into the problem you are solving. For instance, if a tool lacks something that I need for a certain task, then I can just add it.\\\\
So who am I as a person? I think most people would say that I am quite down-to-earth and easy to cooperate with. They would probably also see me as a pretty organized, persistent and creative person. Creativity is something that I really enjoy!\\\\
In my spare time I enjoy adventure, farming, yoga, meditation and hiking.
