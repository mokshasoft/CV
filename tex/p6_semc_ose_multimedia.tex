\item[2008-2009] \textbf{Multimedia Middleware, Sony Ericsson}

\textit{\textbf{Senior Software Consultant, Netville}}

I worked as an architect for a middleware layer that OSE applications used to access multimedia functionality in ST Ericssons mobile platform. The work consisted of video, audio and streaming, but since the summer of 2008 I focused on the streaming parts. The biggest part of the time was spent to troubleshoot the platform, but I also developed new functionality. The code base was written in both Java and ANSI C.
