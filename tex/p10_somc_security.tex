\item[2012-2016] \textbf{Software Security, Sony Mobile}

\textit{\textbf{Self-employed Consultant, Mokshasoft}}

I have learned a lot during this assignment working with both high-level enterprise solutions and low level SW security systems in Android, as well as inventing and implementing an internal tool for bring-up efficiency that I hope will be rolled out in the whole Sony Mobile software organization next year. Working with Android has shown me the merits of functional programming ;) so I implemented this tool in Haskell with elm as front-end. That eventually made me an FP advocate and mentor in my section.

My main contribution to the enterprise team has according to me been code reviews of both old and new code, in addition to refactoring/simplification of old code.

The SW security parts of this assignment mostly dealt with development of cryptographic operations in ARM TrustZone and the framework surrounding it. I also had the chance to work with the Peach fuzzing tool in this area.
