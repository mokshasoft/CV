\textit{\textbf{Studying guided by inspiration}}

After working 10 years for the same company I felt that I needed to take some time of to follow my own inspiration and creativity. There was a lot of projects that I didn't have time to do while I was working, and it was the time to give those ideas some focus. I wanted to develop my skills, not only in my profession, but also in many other areas such as sustainable farming and ecological building. Now after three years I have done what I was thinking about and a lot more. I have learnt a lot within computer science and found a new area of interest, machine-learning.

\begin{itemize}
    \item finished an 11 week course in Machine-Learning
    \item made improvements to the Idris C run-time system
